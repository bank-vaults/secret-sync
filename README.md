**Secret Sync** exposes a generic way to interact with external secret storage systems like [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and provides a set of API models to interact and orchestrate the synchronization of secrets between them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an **early alpha version** and breaking changes are expected.
> As such, it is not recommended for usage in production.
> We are actively working on expanding the list of supported stores and consolidating our APIs.
>
> You can support us with your feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Features

- Simple integration with a variety of secret storage systems
- User-friendly API to facilitate interaction between different storage systems
- Pipeline-like syntax for defining synchronization actions on a secret level
- Advanced templating capabilities for transforming secrets

| **Supported store**                                                      | **Status** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|

| [Local Provider](#secret-store)                                          | alpha      |
| [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager)            | _planned_  |
| [Google Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)        | _planned_  |
| [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) | _planned_  |

## Goals

* Provide safe and simple way to work with secrets
* Expose common API for secret management regardless of the store backend
* Give total control of the secret synchronization process

> Consider a situation where Dev teams need access to secrets from different environments.
> Ops teams can provide access to secrets in the form of an isolated environment (e.g. new Vault instance) synced only with secrets Devs require; all in GitOps way.

## Getting started

To get familiarized, check out the collection of different [examples](examples) using this tool.

## Documentation

Check out the [project documentation](docs) or [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/bank-vaults/secret-sync).

## Development

**For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).**

_Alternatively, install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) on your computer then run `make deps` to install the rest of the dependencies._

Fetch required tools:

```shell
make deps
```

Build the CLI:

```shell
make build
```

Run the test suite:

```shell
make test
```

Run linters:

```shell
make lint # pass -j option to run them in parallel
```

Some linter violations can automatically be fixed:

```shell
make fmt
```
